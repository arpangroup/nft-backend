## Is the referral bonus calculated immediately after a user registers?
In most MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) systems, referral bonus is not immediately calculated upon user registration. Instead, it typically depends on one or more of the following trigger events:

### 🔁 Common Referral Bonus Triggers:
1. **First Deposit or Purchase** <br/>
➤ Referral bonus is awarded when the new user (referee) makes their first qualifying deposit or purchase.

2. **Activation of Account** <br/>
➤ Some MLM systems require users to activate their accounts via payment or product purchase before the bonus is triggered.

3. **Completing a Minimum Requirement** <br/>
➤ Bonus is given only after the referee meets certain conditions (e.g. reaching a rank, inviting others, etc.).

4. **Manual Approval** <br/>
➤ In more controlled systems, referral bonuses are awarded manually after verification.

### ❌ Not Typical:
Awarding referral bonus immediately after registration can lead to abuse and fake account creation, which is why most MLM platforms delay the bonus until some genuine engagement (like a payment or deposit) is done.

### ✅ Best Practice:
Trigger referral bonus after successful business volume (BV) is generated by the referred user. For example:
````java
if (refereeMadeDeposit) {
    calculateAndDistributeReferralBonus(referrerId, depositAmount);
}
````

## What is business value?
In an **MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) system, Business Value (BV)** — sometimes called B**usiness Volume**, **Bonus Volume**, or **Commissionable Volume** — is a point-based or monetary value assigned to a product purchase or transaction, used for calculating bonuses, commissions, and ranks.

### 🔍 Why BV is used instead of actual money?
Because MLM systems often operate in multiple countries or sell various products with different margins, BV standardizes earnings across products and regions. It allows:
- Equal commission calculations.
- Rank progress tracking.
- Compensation consistency.

###  📘 Example:
| Product   | Price (USD) | BV |
| --------- | ----------- | -- |
| Product A | \$100       | 80 |
| Product B | \$50        | 35 |


When a downline buys Product A:
- You don’t earn commission on $100 directly.
- Instead, your system says: “This generates 80 BV.”
- If you get 10% of downline BV, you earn 8 units of commission.

### 🧮 In Code (Java-like):
````java
double bv = product.getBusinessValue();
double commission = bv * 0.10; // 10% referral bonus
````

### 🔁 BV is used in:
- Direct & indirect bonuses
- Matching bonuses
- Rank upgrades
- Group sales target evaluations
